# Welcome!

In this Jupyter Book we start the development of an assessment tool aimed at exploring water efficiency dynamics in almond orchards in Portugal and Spain. The initial tasks will involve:
- Project scoping and definition
- Reviewing and integrating ground truth and historical data
- Exploration and identification of viable open-source data sets (Sentinel, Landsat, etc.) to support the development of functional algorithms

The analysis will use the following framework to go through different topics and asses their viability to develop tools or integrate modules into a general framework.
