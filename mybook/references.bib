ABSTRACT = {Almond cultivation is of great socio-economic importance worldwide. With the demand for almonds steadily increasing due to their nutritional value and versatility, optimizing the management of almond orchards becomes crucial to promote sustainable agriculture and ensure food security. The present systematic literature review, conducted according to the PRISMA protocol, is devoted to the applications of remote sensing technologies in almond orchards, a relatively new field of research. The study includes 82 articles published between 2010 and 2023 and provides insights into the predominant remote sensing applications, geographical distribution, and platforms and sensors used. The analysis shows that water management has a pivotal focus regarding the remote sensing application of almond crops, with 34 studies dedicated to this subject. This is followed by image classification, which was covered in 14 studies. Other applications studied include tree segmentation and parameter extraction, health monitoring and disease detection, and other types of applications. Geographically, the United States of America (USA), Australia and Spain, the top 3 world almond producers, are also the countries with the most contributions, spanning all the applications covered in the review. Other studies come from Portugal, Iran, Ecuador, Israel, Turkey, Romania, Greece, and Egypt. The USA and Spain lead water management studies, accounting for 23% and 13% of the total, respectively. As far as remote sensing platforms are concerned, satellites are the most widespread, accounting for 46% of the studies analyzed. Unmanned aerial vehicles follow as the second most used platform with 32% of studies, while manned aerial vehicle platforms are the least common with 22%. This up-to-date snapshot of remote sensing applications in almond orchards provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, identifying knowledge gaps that may guide future studies and contribute to the sustainability and optimization of almond crop management.},

	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
